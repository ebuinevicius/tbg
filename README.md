# Simple React App Port
This is a port of https://github.com/ebuinevicius/TextBasedGame

EB's text based game code in Java to a React app created with create-react-app as a starter.

This is written as a playground to teach some basics of React and Typescript for a modern SPA.

It includes layout and modern concepts like typescript, React, Functional Components, Hooks and Styled Components.

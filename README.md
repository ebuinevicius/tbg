# Simple React App Port
This was originally a clone of https://github.com/wuntusk/tbg

EB's text based game code in Java to a React app created with create-react-app as a starter.

This is written as a playground to teach some basics of React and Typescript for a modern SPA.

It includes layout and concepts like Typescript, React, Functional Components, Hooks and Styled Components.

The program will be modified to include new components implemented by Erik Buinevicius.


# Installation

You will need git and nodejs installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/wuntusk/tbg
cd tbg
npm i
npm run start
```

You should also have vscode installed and from another terminal window you can run
```
code .
```

or you can open the folder from within vscode.

Any changes you make in vscode should immediately take effect in your browser.


## This isn't a complete port

Many exercises have been left for EB such a mob death, potion drops, etc.
The above functionalities have been implemented by EB as of 11/18/2020.

## TODO

Next steps include finalizing the class system, adding items, changes of stats, kill rewards etc.
